FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS - QA TECHNICAL TEST
--------------------------------------------------

1. E2E AUTOMATION (SauceDemo):
- Successfully validated the complete purchase flow.
- Finding: The use of 'data-test' attributes facilitated the creation of 
  unique and stable selectors, reducing future test maintenance.
- Conclusion: The system correctly responds to success validations after 
  order completion.

2. API AUTOMATION (PetStore):
- Verified POST, GET, and PUT endpoints for pet management.
- Finding: The API allows status and name updates via PUT, and data 
  persistence was correctly validated through status filters.
- Conclusion: Services comply with expected HTTP 200 status codes and 
  return consistent JSON structures.

TECHNICAL VERSATILITY NOTE:
--------------------------------------------------
Cypress was used due to its efficiency in modern environments; 
however, I possess the technical expertise to implement equivalent 
solutions using Selenium WebDriver (Java/Python), among others. 

This allows me to seamlessly integrate into various technological 
ecosystems according to the client's or project's standards.
